# social-proof-section

Shorter post-mortem:
I had a lot of fun on this challenge. The SVGs were tricky to place but I found a good solution--getting better at using the background-position 4-value implementation. 
I spent less time on the responsive scaling this time around. Previously I tinkered to find the best card sizes to lock in the breakpoints, but for this design I decided to let the cards scale a bit more as the page size changes. I like the other implementation better but this was a good time compromise.
On the next few projects I'd like to take a bit more time early in the CSS planning phase to lump together similar properties, like fonts and colors. Targeting and applying styling to lots of items at once, similar to 'componentizing'.
